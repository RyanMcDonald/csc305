- Read through chapters 4, 6, and 7 of the textbook
- Reviewed slides on 3D viewing
- Constructed all the transformation matrices and basic matrix operations based on the textbook notes
- Googled C++ operator overloading to see how to do that. Implemented it for the Vector and Matrix methods
- Tried Googling, searching through multiple textbooks, looking through all of the lecture slides and lab slides and received multiple conflicting answers on how to initialize the view and perspective matrices with initial values.
