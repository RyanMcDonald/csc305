Used the OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook - 2011 by Wolff D.

It provided me with all the necessary information and examples to implement the shaders.

Gouraud
- Referred to Chapter 3 of the book, in the "Shading with a directional light source" example.
- Made slight modifications to make it applicable to the assignment, e.g., hardcoding light intensity and material reflectivity.

Phong
- Referred to Chapter 3 of the book, in the "Using per-fragment shading for improved realism" example. Made slight modifications to make it applicable to the assignment, e.g., hardcoding light intensity and material reflectivity.

Texture
- Referred to Chapter 4 of the book, in the "Applying a 2D texture" example. Made slight modifications to the code to make it applicable to the assignment, e.g., only some of the code had to be added to basicopenglview.cpp as it was already done for us elsewhere.

Bumpmap
- Copied over the texture shaders and basically just added the bumpmap, following the "Using normal maps" example in Chapter 4 of the book.
