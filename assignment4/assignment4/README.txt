Ryan McDonald V00784982 CSC 305 Assignment 4 Raytracer

Read the formulas for ray-sphere and ray-plane intersections in multiple textbooks to try and understand them. Also reviewed raytracing sections in the textbooks.

Followed several raytracing tutorials online. Made modifications to use the Vector and Matrix
classes that we created for the previous assignments. Added plane and sphere classes with their
own intersect methods so when we trace the rays, we could just run that method for every object
in the scene.
